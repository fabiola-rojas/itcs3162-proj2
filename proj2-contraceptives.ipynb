    "Family planning plays a crucial role in public health and economic stability, yet contraceptive use varies significantly based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. Understanding what influences contraceptive choices can help policymakers and healthcare providers develop better strategies for reproductive health education and access.\n",

    "I aim to build a classification model that predicts a woman's contraceptive method choice based on various factors such as education, employment status, and standard of living. I will use the following questions to help uncover insights about the dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the most common contraceptive method?\n",
    "- How are the socioeconomic features distributed?\n",
    "- Does a husband's education and occupation affect their wife's contraceptive method choice?\n",
    "- What are the differences in contraceptive methods based on demographics and socioeconomic factors?\n",
    "- What combinations of factors are most likely to lead to certain choice of contraceptive method? (For example, low education and low standard of living.)\n",

    "The dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. It consists of records of married women who were either not pregnant or were unsure of their pregnancy status at the time of the interview. The dataset contains 10 variables that capture demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the women surveyed, including their age, education level, number of children, religious affiliation, employment status, and exposure to media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable, contraceptive_method, has three categories: \n",
    "- 1 = No-use (The woman does not use any contraceptive method)\n",
    "- 2 = Long-term method (e.g., IUD, sterilization)\n",
    "- 3 = Short-term method (e.g., pill, condom, injection)\n",
    "  \n",
    "The categorical variables have already been encoded as numerical values, making it easier for machine learning models to process. A key aspect of this project will be understanding the relationships between these features and contraceptive choices through data visualization and classification modeling.\n",
